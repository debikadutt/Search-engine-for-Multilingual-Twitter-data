# Search-engine-for-Multilingual-Twitter-data
Collected and indexed more than 10K tweets in four different languages, such as English, French, Russian and German, to be queried from Solr. Implemented language detection and translation, i.e Cross lingual search with the help of Yandex API through JavaScript, which returns results to users in more than one language. Successfully built a rich user experience by adding faceting functionality by which users were able to quickly spot the most relevant search results. Faceted search results provide an easy-to-scan, browser friendly display that helps users quickly narrow down each search. Displayed content in an organized fashion on the website by implementing Tag Cloud which helps in website navigation as the terms are hyperlinked to items associated with the tag.
